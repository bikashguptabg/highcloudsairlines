High Clouds Airlines Capstone Project
Project Overview
This capstone project presents a comprehensive analysis of High Cloud Airlines, focusing on optimizing the airline's performance and enhancing operational efficiency. The project includes the development of three interactive dashboards using Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, alongside SQL queries to validate the accuracy of the data.

Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of High Cloud Airlines' operations, with a focus on optimizing performance and improving customer satisfaction.

Key Goals
Identify Trends: Analyze flight data to uncover patterns in passenger traffic, peak travel times, and popular routes.
Operational Efficiency: Evaluate load factors, identify the busiest routes, and determine the top preferred airlines by passengers.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Use insights from the analysis to support strategic decision-making for future growth and sustainability.
Expected Outcome
The project aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations that will drive operational efficiency, enhance profitability, and improve customer satisfaction for High Cloud Airlines.

Methods Used
Data Collection and Cleaning: Imported data from multiple sheets, performed data cleaning (renaming columns, adjusting data types), and ensured data accuracy.
Data Connection & Modeling: Created data models in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and performed SQL joins to establish relationships between different tables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Calculated key metrics like Load Factor using SUM(TotalPassengers)/SUM(AvailableSeats).
Segmented data, such as categorizing days into weekdays and weekends.
Data Visualization:
Utilized various charts (bar, line, KPI Cards, etc.) and heatmaps to visualize trends, correlations, and anomalies.
Applied date and location filters to study the data by origin and destination flights.
Reporting & Dashboarding: Developed dynamic dashboards using Power BI and Tableau to provide real-time insights.
Cross Verification through SQL Queries: Validated the reliability of the reports and dashboards by executing SQL queries.
Recommendations
Operational Focus: Address low load factors in Q1 through targeted promotions or schedule adjustments.
Carrier Optimization: Evaluate carrier efficiency to enhance aircraft utilization.
Strategic Adjustments: Reassess pricing and operational strategies for short-distance routes to improve load factors.
