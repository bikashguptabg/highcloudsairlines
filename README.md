# High Clouds Airlines Capstone Project - Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL & PowerPoint Presentation
A comprehensive analysis of High Cloud Airlines, focusing on optimizing performance and enhancing operations of the airline industry. As part of this project, I built 3 interactive dashboards in Excel, Power & Tableau and fired SQL queries to validate all the values.
#Important - All the files have been attached to the repository, however Excel file is larger than 25MB so unable to add it to the repository. But from this link you can download the Excel file as well:

Purpose: 
To perform a comprehensive analysis of High Cloud Airlines' operations, focusing on optimizing performance and enhancing customer satisfaction.

Key Goals:
Identify Trends: Analyze flight data to uncover patterns in passenger traffic, peak travel times, and popular routes.
Operational Efficiency: Evaluate load factors, busiest routes, top preferred airlines by the passengers.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Utilize insights from the analysis to support strategic decision-making for future growth and sustainability.

Expected Outcome: 
Provide actionable insights and recommendations that drive efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction for High Cloud Airlines.

Methods Used:
Data Collection and Cleaning:
Imported the data from different sheets and performed data cleaning (renaming columns and changing their datatypes)
Data Connection & Modelling:
Created data modelling in Excel, Power BI and Tableau and performed joins in MySQL to create a relationship between the different tables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Descriptive Statistics: Calculated key metrics like Load Factor by SUM(TotalPasengers)/SUM(Available Seats). Segmenting some columns like ‘WeekdayType’ into weekdays & weekends.
Data Visualization: Utilized charts (bar, line, KPI Cards, etc.) and heatmaps to visualize trends, correlations, and anomalies. Used Date and Location Filters as well to study the data by origin and destination flights.
Reporting & Dashboarding:
Developed dynamic dashboards using Power BI/Tableau for real-time insights.
Cross Verify through SQL Queries:
Verified all the values by firing SQL queries to validate the reliability of the reports and the dashboards.

Recommendations: 
Operational Focus: Address Q1 low load factors through targeted promotions or schedule adjustments.
Carrier Optimization: Evaluate carrier efficiency to enhance aircraft utilization.
Strategic Adjustments: Reassess pricing and operational strategies for short-distance routes to improve load factors.
