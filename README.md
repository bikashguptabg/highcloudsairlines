## 🎯 Purpose  
The primary objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of High Cloud Airlines' operations, with a focus on optimizing performance and improving customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Key Goals  
- **Identify Trends**: Analyze flight data to uncover patterns in passenger traffic, peak travel times, and popular routes.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Evaluate load factors, identify the busiest routes, and determine the top preferred airlines by passengers.  
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Use insights from the analysis to support strategic decision-making for future growth and sustainability.

## 🎯 Expected Outcome  
The project aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations that will drive operational efficiency, enhance profitability, and improve customer satisfaction for High Cloud Airlines.

## ⚙️ Methods Used  

- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Imported data from multiple sheets, performed data cleaning (renaming columns, adjusting data types), and ensured data accuracy.  
- **Data Connection & Modeling**: Created data models in Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and performed SQL joins to establish relationships between different tables.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
    - Calculated key metrics like Load Factor using `SUM(TotalPassengers)/SUM(AvailableSeats)`.  
    - Segmented data, such as categorizing days into weekdays and weekends.  
- **Data Visualization**:  
    - Utilized various charts (bar, line, KPI Cards, etc.) and heatmaps to visualize trends, correlations, and anomalies.  
    - Applied date and location filters to study the data by origin and destination flights.  
- **Reporting & Dashboarding**: Developed dynamic dashboards using Power BI and Tableau to provide real-time insights.  
- **Cross Verification through SQL Queries**: Validated the reliability of the reports and dashboards by executing SQL queries.

## 💡 Recommendations  

- **Operational Focus**: Address low load factors in Q1 through targeted promotions or schedule adjustments.  
- **Carrier Optimization**: Evaluate carrier efficiency to enhance aircraft utilization.  
- **Strategic Adjustments**: Reassess pricing and operational strategies for short-distance routes to improve load factors.
